# Vaccine-temperature-management-IoMT

This project focuses on leveraging Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to ensure optimal temperature
conditions for vaccine storage and transportation. It integrates IoT-enabled sensors to monitor real-time temperature
data and provides automated alerts in case of deviations. A cloud-based system stores and analyzes the data for
decision-making and compliance tracking. The solution enhances vaccine efficacy by preventing spoilage due to
temperature fluctuations. It also ensures transparency and efficiency in vaccine logistics.
